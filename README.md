## Summary
Today, Ethereum gas prices make it very difficult and expensive to interact with Aragon DAOs. It can cost as much as $4 to vote on a proposal and $10 to create a proposal in Aragon DAOs. AragonOnMatic migrates an existing organization to the Matic sidechain and allows users to migrate their Aragon state to the Mainnet at much cheaper costs.

## Developer Quick Start

As Matic puts it: "If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Matic developer. All the tools you're familiar with are supported on Matic out of the box: Truffle, Remix, Web3js. Switch over to Matic's RPC and get started!"

## How To Use

This solution helps you moe your current Aragon org from Mainnet to Matic, and interface with the same Aragaon DAO UI your org already knows and loves, but with cheaper transaction costs. $2 to vote is a bit high right? That's what it is these days, and it's just not realistic.
